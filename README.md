# AI Example Troubleshooting Guide

This document provides a step-by-step guide to troubleshoot and fix issues related to the execution of the `ai_example` program.

## **1. Running the AI Application**
To execute the AI application, use:
```bash
./ai_example
```

If the output stops at `Summary: Processed:` without completing, follow the steps below to diagnose and fix the issue.

---

## **2. Capture Debug Output**
To check for hidden errors or missing output, run:
```bash
./ai_example 2>&1 | tee debug.log
```
This saves all output, including errors, into `debug.log`. Open it using:
```bash
cat debug.log
```
and check for errors.

---

## **3. Ensure AI Processing Completes**
If the AI processing function is not returning the expected summary:
- Check if the function responsible for summarization is being called.
- Add debug prints before and after the summarization step:
  
  ```cpp
  std::cout << "Processing summary..." << std::endl;
  std::cout << "Summary: " << summary << std::endl;
  ```

---

## **4. Check for Memory Issues**
If the program crashes, it might be due to memory corruption. Compile with AddressSanitizer:
```bash
g++ -fsanitize=address -g ai_example.cpp -o ai_example
./ai_example
```
This will detect memory errors such as buffer overflows and use-after-free issues.

---

## **5. Debug for Infinite Loops or Blocking Code**
If the AI processing does not complete:
- Ensure no loops are running indefinitely.
- Insert logs before and after key function calls to trace execution:
  ```cpp
  std::cout << "Entering AI Processing..." << std::endl;
  ai_process();
  std::cout << "AI Processing Completed." << std::endl;
  ```
- If the program expects user input, ensure that input is being provided correctly.

---

## **6. Recompile and Run with Debugging**
If errors persist, compile with debugging symbols enabled:
```bash
g++ -g ai_example.cpp -o ai_example
```
Run the program inside a debugger:
```bash
gdb ./ai_example
```
Inside GDB, start execution:
```gdb
run
```
If the program crashes, use:
```gdb
backtrace
```
to get details on where the crash occurred.

---

## **7. Check for Missing Dependencies**
If your program relies on external libraries:
- Ensure all required libraries are installed.
- Run `ldd` to check linked dependencies:
  ```bash
  ldd ./ai_example
  ```
  If any dependency is missing, install it using the package manager.

---

## **8. Final Fix and Retry**
After making necessary changes, recompile and rerun:
```bash
g++ ai_example.cpp -o ai_example
./ai_example
```

If the issue persists, repeat the debugging steps or check the logic in the AI processing function.

---

## **Conclusion**
This guide provides a structured approach to diagnosing and fixing execution issues in your AI program. If you encounter further problems, reviewing logs, adding debug statements, and using debugging tools will help pinpoint and resolve them efficiently.
